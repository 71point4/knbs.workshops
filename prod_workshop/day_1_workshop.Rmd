* R vs RStudio
> **R and RStudio are two distinctly different applications that serve different purposes. R is the software that performs the actual instructions. It’s the workhorse. Without R installed on your computer or server, you would not be able to run any commands. RStudio is a software that provides a nifty interface to R. It’s sometimes referred to as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Its purpose is to provide bells and whistles that can improve your experience with the R software.**

# What is the tidyverse?

> The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

This collection contains some of the most used libaries that an `R` data scientist will use on a daily basis. The most used packages are probably `dplyr` and `ggplot`. Today we gonna explore the _basics_ of the `dplyr` package.

.pull-left[
* `dplyr` is the grammar of data manipulation (`select`, `filter`, `group_by`, `mutate`)
* `ggplot` is the grammar of graphics - beyond the scope of this workshop (useful resources: [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2-book.org/))

# What is the tidyverse?

Although we only going to be learning the basics of the tidyverse universe, there is A LOT more to explore in terms of the power of programming languages like `R` (and `Python`).

We recommend R for data analyses due to its firm pedigree in statistical analysis. `Python` is getting better at manipulating data with packages like `pandas` and alike, while `R` has become a more general language over the last few years. 

Even though `python` does offer some nice integration features,  `R` offers a much better ecosystem that supports reproducible research and data analysis (`Rmarkdown`, `blogdown`, `targets` etc. ).

Also, once you grasp the fundamentals of programming, it is very easy to learn another language if it is better suited towards what you want to achieve.

# Using Projects

Seemless collaboration and reporducibilty requires us to keep all of our _notes_, _scripts_, _data_ and _output_ in one single place. Why? 

Rstudio makes it easy by creating a project. 

Start by creating a folder in your `home` directory called `projects` and starting a project called `learning_dplyr`.

* Next click on the menu: 

- `File > New Project > Existing Directory`

# Side note: using Rmarkdown for analysis

Lets make it look nice by changing the `yaml` at the top:

```{yml, echo=TRUE}

  html_document:
    theme: journal
    highlight: espresso
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 4
    toc_float: true
    code_folding: show

Now, very important, lets set the default settings for the document:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE)
```

# Side note: using Rmarkdown for analysis

> Rmarkdown can render outputs in `html`, `pdf`, `docx` and `ppt`

# Useful terminlogy for workshop

* **Package**
  * In R, the fundamental unit of shareable code is the package. A package bundles together code, data, documentation, and tests, and is easy to share with others. 
  * Comprehensive R Archive Network, or **CRAN**, is the public clearing house for R packages.
  
<!-- Source: https://r-pkgs.org/intro.html- -->  
<br>

* **Pipe operator**
  * The pipe operator is a special operational function available under the magrittr and dplyr package (basically developed under magrittr), which allows us to pass the result of one function/argument to the other one in sequence. It is generally denoted by symbol %>% in R Programming.
  
  * Keyboard shortcut: `ctrl` + `shift` + `m`
  
  * Note you can view all keyboard shortcuts with: `alt` + `shift` + `k` 
  
  * Shortcuts can be modified through the **Tools** menu at the top of your RStudio IDE

# Useful terminlogy for workshop

* **Function**
  * In R, a function is an object so the R interpreter is able to pass control to the function, along with arguments that may be necessary for the function to accomplish the actions

<!-- Source: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_functions.htm#:~:text=In%20R%2C%20a%20function%20is,be%20stored%20in%20other%20objects. -->

<br>

* **Assign**
  * To do useful and interesting things in R, we need to assign values to objects. To create an object, we need to give it a name followed by the assignment operator <-, and the value we want to give it.
  
  * Keyboard shortcut: `alt` + `-` (dash)

# Useful terminlogy for workshop

* **Loop**
  * A `loop` is a control statement that allows multiple executions of a statement or a set of statements. The word 'looping' means cycling or iterating.

<!-- Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/loops-in-r-for-while-repeat/#:~:text=In%20R%20programming%2C%20we%20require,looping'%20means%20cycling%20or%20iterating. -->

<br>

* **Apply**
  * `apply` functions are a family of functions in base R which allow you to repetitively perform an action on multiple chunks of data. An apply function is essentially a loop, but run faster than loops and often require less code.

# Useful terminlogy for workshop

.pull-left[

* **Map**
  * The `map` functions transform their input by applying a function to each element of a list or atomic vector and returning an object of the same length as the input. A map function is a more elegant version of a loop (requires less code therefore less room for error)

<!-- Source: https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map.html#:~:text=map.Rd,same%20type%20as%20the%20input. -->

<br>

* **Joins**
  * We can merge two data frames in R by using the join of functions.

# Useful terminlogy for workshop

* **If statements**
  * It is one of the easiest decision-making statements. It is used to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will be executed or not i.e if a certain condition is true then a block of statement is executed otherwise not.
  
<!-- Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/r-if-statement/#:~:text=It%20is%20one%20of%20the,execute%20if%20condition%20is%20true%20%7D -->  

<br>

* **Scripts**
  * A script is simply a text file containing a set of commands and comments. The script can be saved and used later to re-execute the saved commands. The script can also be edited so you can execute a modified version of the commands.
  
  * Keyboard shortcut: `ctrl` + `shift` + `n`
  
  * Comments in R  scripts are preceded by the `#` (pound/hastag) symbol

# Projects in R

.pull-left[
* **What is a project?**
  * A project is simply a working directory designated with a `.RProj` file. When you open a project (using File/Open Project in RStudio or by double–clicking on the `.Rproj` file outside of R), the working directory will automatically be set to the directory that the `.RProj` file is located in.
<!-- Source: https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/projects-in-rstudio.html -->  
* **Why use projects?**
  * Eliminates early-stage hassle and confusion around reading in and exporting data. Setting up a working directory properly also helps build up good habits that are conducive to reproducible analysis.

# Manipulating objects with dplyr

We can use the `dplyr` library to manipulate the data using very basic functions:

.pull-left[
* `select`: Selects specific columns by name.
* `filter`: Filter data based on certain criteria.
* `mutate`: Create a new column.
* `group_by`: Column to aggregate on.
* `summarise`: How do you want to summarise the data?
]

.pull-right[

In `R` we gonna _chain_ these commands using whats called the `pipe` operator: `%>%`. The shortcut to print this symbol is: `Ctrl + Shift + m`. 

> We read this `%>%` symbol as: _and then_

* So for instance `mtcars %>% select(mpg)` reads in english as: Take object `mtcars` _and then_ select column `mpg`.

* Another would be `mtcars %>% filter(mpg < 22)` : Take object `mtcars` _and then_ filter out rows where `mpg` is more than 22.

]

---
class: large

# select()

Extract columns by name: `select(.data, ...)`

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
mtcars %>% select(mpg, cyl, disp)
```

We can also use smart selectors:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
iris %>% select(Species, contains("Sepal"))
```

Or even ranges:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
iris %>% select(Species, Sepal.Length:Petal.Length)
```

---
class: large

# filter()

![:scale 85%](images/dplyr_filter.jpg)
.footnote[
_ Art by [Allison Horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations)_
]

---
class: large

# filter()

What if we want to only analyze certain rows? In `dplyr` we use the `filter()` function:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
mtcars %>% filter(mpg < 22)
```

We can use multiple conditions to filter (this represents an `AND`):

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
mtcars %>% filter(mpg < 22, cyl < 8, gear < 4)
```

The special function `%in%` also gets used often to specify multiple conditions:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
iris %>% filter(Species %in% c("virginica", "setosa"))
```

Its also possible to create `OR` filters using the `pipe` delimiter ("|"):

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
iris %>% filter(Petal.Width > 0.2 | Sepal.Width == 3.5)
```

---
class: large


# mutate()

![:scale 55%](images/dplyr_mutate.png)
.footnote[
_ Art by [Allison Horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations)_
]

---
class: large

# mutate()

Often you will need to add a new column that you derive. To accomplish this using `dplyr` we use `mutate`. Lets calculate the price per carat using the `diamonds` dataset from `ggplot2`:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
diamonds %>% mutate(price_per_carat = price/carat)
```

We might also want to get the price in KSh and not USD, so lets create a `price_ksh` column:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
diamonds %>% mutate(price_ksh = price*116)
```

Another nice feature we can use is the `case_when` function inside the mutate:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
diamonds %>% 
  mutate(carat_type = case_when(
    carat < 1 ~ "less than 1 carat",
    between(carat, 1, 3) ~ "1 - 3 carats",
    TRUE ~ "more than 3 carats"
  ))
```

---
class: large

# group_by() & summarise()

We might want to run an aggregation over a certain variables to calculate means, medians, etc. 

This can be done in `R` using dplyr `group_by` and `summarise`. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  summarise(ave_mpg = mean(mpg, na.rm = T))
```
