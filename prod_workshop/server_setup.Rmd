# Preamble

> **The following software is required for the pipeline:**

* MariaDB - opensource version of MySQL database management system (used for data curation)

* R and RStudio - software for ETL (preparing data and populating indicators)

The slides below provide instructions for installing this software on the server and setting up users.

> **Everything is done via the command line**

# MariaDB installation

# MariaDB installation

* The code chunk below will install `mariadb` on the server and take you through a series of prompts where you can make some changes to your MariaDB installation’s security options

```{bash}
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mariadb-server
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

* The first prompt will ask you to enter the current database root password. Since you have not set one up yet, press ENTER to indicate “none”

```{bash}


# NOTE: RUNNING ALL PARTS OF THIS SCRIPT IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL MariaDB
#       SERVERS IN PRODUCTION USE!  PLEASE READ EACH STEP CAREFULLY!
# 
# In order to log into MariaDB to secure it, we'll need the current
# password for the root user.  If you've just installed MariaDB, and
# you haven't set the root password yet, the password will be blank,
# so you should just press enter here.
# 
# Enter current password for root (enter for none):
```

---
class: .large

# MariaDB installation

* Be sure to enter "n". You can always add a password to the root user later for extra security.

```{bash}
# OK, successfully used password, moving on...
# 
# Setting the root password ensures that nobody can log into the MariaDB
# root user without the proper authorisation.
# 
# Set root password? [Y/n] N
```

* For the rest, you can say "Y"

```{r}
# By default, a MariaDB installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone
# to log into MariaDB without having to have a user account created for
# them.  This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation
# go a bit smoother.  You should remove them before moving into a
# production environment.
# 
# Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y
#  ... Success!
```

---
class: .large

# MariaDB installation

* For the rest, you can say "Y"

```{bash}
# 
# Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'.  This
# ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.
# 
# Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] Y
#  ... Success!
# 
# By default, MariaDB comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can
# access.  This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed
# before moving into a production environment.
# 
# Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] Y
#  - Dropping test database...
#  ... Success!
#  - Removing privileges on test database...
#  ... Success!
```

---
class: .large

# MariaDB installation

* For the rest, you can say "Y"

```{bash}
# 
# Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes made so far
# will take effect immediately.
# 
# Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] Y
#  ... Success!
# 
# Cleaning up...
# 
# All done!  If you've completed all of the above steps, your MariaDB
# installation should now be secure.
# 
# Thanks for using MariaDB!
```

class: .large

# MariaDB installation

* Testing MariaDB - the code below should show that MariaDB is running

```{bash}
sudo systemctl status mariadb

# ● mariadb.service - MariaDB 10.3.34 database server
#     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/mariadb.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
#     Active: active (running) since Thu 2022-04-07 09:17:42 UTC; 1min 11s ago
#       Docs: man:mysqld(8)
#             https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/systemd/
#   Main PID: 2450 (mysqld)
#     Status: "Taking your SQL requests now..."
#      Tasks: 31 (limit: 38511)
#     Memory: 63.7M
#     CGroup: /system.slice/mariadb.service
#             └─2450 /usr/sbin/mysqld

```

# Setup MySQL

* Next we need to create a user and profile for MySQL

* This is done via the `~/.my.cnf` configuration file

  * We use `vim` for editing text files, but you could use another text editor (e.g. `nano`) if you prefer

```{bash}
vim /home/knbs/.my.cnf
```

Input the following in the file and save it - this creates a user called `knbs` with a password (change from default provided below) and chooses `less` as the terminal pager for query results.

```{bash}
[client]
user = knbs
password = knbs_cahf_fsdk_reall_71point4_housing # put a different password of your choosing here
pager = less -S
```

---
class: .large

# Setup MySQL

* We now need to create this user in `mysql` too

* First launch `mysql` as root (recall we didn't set a password for root)

```{bash}
sudo mysql -u root

```

* Then create the `knbs` user - this user will have all privileges on the system

```{sql}
CREATE USER 'knbs'@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'knbs_fsdk_reall_71point4_housing';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'knbs'@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'knbs_cahf_fsdk_reall_71point4_housing';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

* At this point you should be able to login in to `mysql` as the `knbs` user:

```{bash}
mysql
mysql -u knbs -p
```

# R-base installation

class: .large

# R-base installation

* We first install base R using the code below 

  * Note that for ubuntu 20.04 LTS the repository is `focal_cran40`, for Ubuntu 18 it is `bionic40`

```{bash}
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9
sudo add-apt-repository 'deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu focal-cran40/'
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y r-base
```

* Launch R to see if installation was successfull by typing `R` in the terminal

```{bash}
R
#
# R version 4.1.3 (2022-03-10) -- "One Push-Up"
# Copyright (C) 2022 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
# Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)

class: .large

# RStudio server installation

* Instructions are available on [Rstudio's](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download-server/debian-ubuntu/) website

```{bash}
sudo apt-get install gdebi-core 
mkdir downloads && cd downloads 
wget https://download2.rstudio.org/server/bionic/amd64/rstudio-server-2021.09.1-372-amd64.deb 
sudo gdebi rstudio-server-2021.09.1-372-amd64.deb
```

* The installation should end showing that `rstudio-server` is up and running

```{bash}
# ● rstudio-server.service - RStudio Server
#      Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/rstudio-server.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
#      Active: active (running) since Thu 2022-04-07 09:59:01 UTC; 1s ago
#     Process: 13927 ExecStart=/usr/lib/rstudio-server/bin/rserver (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
#    Main PID: 13928 (rserver)

#              └─13928 /usr/lib/rstudio-server/bin/rserver
```

class: .large

# RStudio server installation

* Next we need to configure `rstudio-server` to accept connections from specific ports. See [this guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio-server/rstudio-server-pro-0.98.507-admin-guide.pdf) for more information

  * Note the port can be changed, default is just `8787`
  * By default `rstudio-server` binds to `0.0.0.0` this can also be changed
  * Changes only take effect after restarting the service: `sudo rstudio-server restart`
  
* These configurations are made in `/etc/rstudio/rserver.conf`

```{bash}
sudo vim /etc/rstudio/rserver.conf
```

* Input the following into the file:

```{bash}
www-port=8787
```

---
class: .large

# RStudio server installation

* A few useful dependencies to install include:

```{bash}
sudo apt-get install -y default-jre 
sudo apt-get install -y default-jdk 
sudo R CMD javareconf

sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev
sudo apt install libxml2-dev 
sudo apt install libssl-dev 
sudo apt install libmariadbclient-dev 
sudo apt install libpq-dev 
sudo apt install libsodium-dev
```

---
class: .large

# RStudio server installation

* You should be able to login to RStudio by going to the ipaddress of the server with port 8787 

  * e.g. `197.85.3.47:8787`

  * Login using the `knbs` user credentials (the ubuntu user name and password, not the `mysql` password as per `/home/knbs/.my.cnf`)
  
* Then install the following additional packages through the RStudio console

```{r}
install.packages("rJava", Ncpus = 4)
install.packages("tidyverse", Ncpus = 4)
install.packages("RMySQL", Ncpus = 4)
install.packages("RPostgres", Ncpus = 4)
install.packages("glue", Ncpus = 4)
install.packages("plumber", Ncpus = 4)
install.packages("vroom", Ncpus = 4)
install.packages("renv", Ncpus = 4)
install.packages("lubridate", Ncpus = 4)
```
